# Walkthrough

## 1.	Create a Process application


![](screenshots/300/pt5/1.png)

![](screenshots/300/pt12/1.png)

On the left panel of the OIC homepage, press processes and then Process Application.

![](screenshots/300/pt12/2.png)

On the right side of the screen, press Create.


![](screenshots/300/pt12/3.png)

Pick the 'Create an Application' option.

![](screenshots/300/pt12/4.png)

Name your application, you can leave it in 'My Space.'

![](screenshots/300/pt12/6.png)


Create a structured process from scratch.

![](screenshots/300/pt12/7.png)

Start with a message, in this case the message will invoked from an integration, but can also be received via an API call to the OIC API. 

![](screenshots/300/pt12/8.png)

Click Start and open its properties. 
![](screenshots/300/pt12/9.png)
Definte the interface with the fields from the previous labs, but leave out 'ApprovedStatus'.

![](screenshots/300/pt12/10.png)

On the left of the screen press forms. 


![](screenshots/300/pt12/11.png)

Create a new form.

![](screenshots/300/pt12/12.png)

Drag & drop some input fields from the Basic Palette to the center.

![](screenshots/300/pt12/13.png)

For these input panels, give them Names & Binding that correspond to the field names of the CPQ data table. For the Label, you can add a space for the fields.

![](screenshots/300/pt12/14.png)

Your form should look like this upon completion.


![](screenshots/300/pt12/15.png)

Reconfigure the form to your liking. 

![](screenshots/300/pt12/16.png)

Place a Text Area below your other fields. 


![](screenshots/300/pt12/17.png)

Name it Comments.


![](screenshots/300/pt12/20.png)

Give it a placeholder.

![](screenshots/300/pt12/18.png)

For the previous fields, change all of their properties to be 'Read Only.' Do not do this for Comments. 

![](screenshots/300/pt12/21.png)

From the right, drag & drop a Humman Approve action to the line.

![](screenshots/300/pt12/22.png)

Open its properties.


![](screenshots/300/pt12/23.png)

Under properties, press the pencil to the right of Form and select your form created earlier.

![](screenshots/300/pt12/24.png)

Press the arrow left of Due Date and press Interval, set the time interval to 7 days. 

![](screenshots/300/pt12/26.png)

Press User task and open data association.

![](screenshots/300/pt12/27.png)

This data associate shows thenewProductSubmissionDataObject's fields are mapped to the newProductSubmission fields on the right. Do not change anything on this screen. You can press cancel on the upper right to close the screen.

![](screenshots/300/pt12/28.png)

Now open the data association for the Start icon.

![](screenshots/300/pt12/29.png)

We need to associate the defined fields for the User task fields related to our Product Form. 

![](screenshots/300/pt12/30.png)

Drag and drop the correspondonig fields from the left to the start fields, and the corresponding fields from the right to be under NewProduct. Press apply, then save, on the top right.


![](screenshots/300/pt12/31.png)

Now we can activate our application.

![](screenshots/300/pt12/32.png)

Activate a new version of the application.

## 1a. Authentication/Authorization

We must configure our Process to authorize our OIC service account to call it and yourself as a user.

![](screenshots/300/pt4/1.png)

From the OIC homepage, press 'My tasks' on the left, then work space on the upper right of this screen.

![](screenshots/300/pt4/3.png)

Open Administration.

![](screenshots/300/pt4/4.png)

Press Manage Roles, then search for your business process in the search box. Select the 'X.Process Owner' role. Press the 'Add Member' button.

![](screenshots/300/pt4/5.png)

Add your self and your instance's service account as process owners. Press Save and you can close this screen.

## 2. Integration reconfiguration

### Cloud ERP to Process

![](screenshots/300/pt5/14.png)
![](screenshots/300/pt5/15.png)


Clone your original integration, but rename it to 'ERP2Process'. 
![](screenshots/300/pt5/16.png)

Open the integration and delete the SOAP connection to CPQ. 
![](screenshots/300/pt5/17.png)

From the right hand side of the screen, open the palette and under integration, drag&drop the Process icon to the orchestration. Select your process name.
![](screenshots/300/pt5/18.png)

Leave the default options

![](screenshots/300/pt5/2.png)

Map the same fields as last time from ERP, but instead on the right map them to the Process fields.

![](screenshots/300/pt5/4.png)

Save your integration.

![](screenshots/300/pt5/11.png)

If you test your integration and it fails, you can check its status under tracking. View the Errors. You may have forgotten to give your service account the role of Process Owner in step 1a.

### Process to CPQ

Create a new integration. Begin with a generic REST adapter and gave it this payload:

```
{"ProductID":"","ProductName":"","CreationDate":"", "Division":"","Description":"","ApprovalStatus":""}
```
After that, select your CPQ connection from the previous lab. 

![](screenshots/300/pt5/6.png)

Map the fields from your JSON payload to the CPQ fields.

![](screenshots/300/pt5/7.png)

![](screenshots/300/pt5/9.png)

Your mapping should look like either of the 2 above screenshots by the end. 
![](screenshots/300/pt5/8.png)

This is what your integration should look like, we can leave the last mapper empty because we are not returning information to this REST endpoint. 

![](screenshots/300/pt5/9.png)

Give your new integration a tracking variable, I gave it ProductID as mine. Save and close. Back at this screen you can activate your integration.

## 3. Synergy of Process & Integration

With our integrations reconfigured, we can now add them to our process. From the right hand side of the screen, drag and drop integration to the orchestration.

![](screenshots/300/pt3/1.png)

With the integration added, now place an Exclusive Gateway between the User task and Integration.

![](screenshots/300/pt3/1b.png)
Open the data associate for the integration.

![](screenshots/300/pt3/1c.png)

Associate the fields from user task to the JSON payload for the integration.
![](screenshots/300/pt3/2.png)

Add a notification task as well.


![](screenshots/300/pt3/8.png)

We will be adding information to To, Body, and Subject.

![](screenshots/300/pt3/9.png)

Press the notification task and the fx next to 'To'. Put in your email address.

![](screenshots/300/pt3/10.png)

Press the fx right of Body on the right. Drag and drop the productName field into the Editor. Then press Validate and OK.



![](screenshots/300/pt3/20.png)

This is what your configuration should look like.


![](screenshots/300/pt3/3.png)

Press notification and the cursor symbol, drag the line to the end icon. This means the process will end after the notification task.

![](screenshots/300/pt3/4.png)

Click the line between the exclusive gateway and notification. Press the pencil. In the menu below, press the pencil symbol next to Condition. When the next popup appears, drag and drop 'TaskOutcomeDataObject' and after put 

```
== "REJECT"
```

Validate and close this screen. In the name field, put 'Rejected'.

![](screenshots/300/pt3/5.png)

For the other line from the gateway, click it, the pencil and name it 'approved'.

![](screenshots/300/pt3/6.png)

Now press Save in the upper right, then press Publish. You can see your changes since you last published in the popup. Press publish.
![](screenshots/300/pt3/7.png)

Leave it on 'Last Published Version'.

![](screenshots/300/pt3/12.png)

Make sure to now check mark all of the boxes and that the revision id is 1.0. Congratulations, your process is now active!

## 4. Testing the business process

To begin the business process, [create an item in Cloud ERP.](https://github.com/GaryHostt/OIC_SaaS_integration/blob/master/Lab200.md)

The item will now appear under My Tasks. 

![](screenshots/300/pt3/12a.png)

Open the Task by pressing anywhere on the row. 

![](screenshots/300/pt3/13.png)

In this case, we can reject the task. After doing so press the workspace button.

![](screenshots/300/pt3/14.png)

After pressing workspace and processes on the left, you can see a list of previous tasks and view the entire audit trail. 

![](screenshots/300/pt3/16.png)

We can see the full audit trail for our rejected Engine. 

## 5. Rejections & embedding

We don't want to lose our rejected products just because they aren't going to CPQ. Also, what if instead of having users login to OIC to see tasks - we could let them take care of approvals & rejections straight from CPQ? Stay tuned for Lab400 to see how Oracle Cloud can empower you!
