# Lab 100: Integrating with CPQ Data Tables 

## Introduction

This lab will show how to send data via a REST endpoint to be added to a CPQ datatable using Oracle Integration. The CPQ table we create will be used for Product ID mapping between CPQ and other systems. 

**_To log issues_**, click here to go to the [github Oracle](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/issues/new) repository issue submission form.

## Objectives

â€¢	Create a REST endpoint that will receive a JSON payload. The integration then sends the data to CPQ via a SOAP connection. The REST endpoint then returns a confirmation of submission. 

## Reference

This is also how your integration will look at the end of the walkthrough.

During the walkthrough, relevant instructions will be UNDER the picture they correlate with.

To create this integration, you need the old integration mapper. The UI for this mapper is shown in part 3 - 'Create the Integration'.

# Walkthrough

### 1.	Create the Data Table in CPQ

![](screenshots/100/1.png)

First sign in to your CPQ environment. 

![](screenshots/100/2.png)

This is the CPQ home screen. Click the gear symbol on the upper right. 

![](screenshots/100/3.png)

Then this screen will appear, click Data Tables under Developer Tools. 

![](screenshots/100/5.png)

Click "+ Add" and create a folder, the name can be anything. 
![](screenshots/100/6.png)

After creating the folder, click the "+ Add" again and create a table. Make sure the Parent Folder of the table is the one you just created. 

![](screenshots/100/7.png)

Then create the fields for the table, do this by pressing "+ Add Column." Create the fields per this screenshot. 

![](screenshots/100/8.png)

After creating the fields, click the checkbox next to live and then press save. 

![](screenshots/100/9.png)

Return to this screen by clicking the gear symbol in the upper right and then click Web Servies under Integration Platform. 

![](screenshots/100/10.png)

Make sure the Web Service Version is 2.0. Then select the add API with the ProductMappings table you just created. Keep this window open, we will need it later. Next, we will go to Oracle Integration. 

### 2.	Create the SOAP Connection

![](screenshots/100/11.png)

This is the Oracle Integration home screen. If you need to learn how to spin up OIC and get to the screen please click HERE. Begin by pressing integrations on the left. 

![](screenshots/100/12.png)

Then click connections on the left. 

![](screenshots/100/13.png)

Click create on the top right. 

![](screenshots/100/14.png)

Scroll down on the pop up and then select the SOAP adapter. 

![](screenshots/100/15.png)

Name your connection. Leave it on Trigger and Invoke. 

![](screenshots/100/16.png)

Return to your CPQ screen and copy the SOAP Server URL (highlighted in blue). 

![](screenshots/100/17.png)

On the OIC connection screen, click configure connectivity and paste that value in the WSDL URL field. MAKE SURE YOU ADD "?wsdl" at the end of the url you paste. 

![](screenshots/100/18.png)

Scroll down and press configure security. Here, input your username and password. After this, test and save your connection. If a popup appears when you press test, press "test & validate." 


### 3.	Create the Integration


![](screenshots/100/19.png)

From this screen, make sure your connection has the green check mark. Then press integrations on the left. 

![](screenshots/100/20.png)

On the top right, click create and this pop up will appear. Click select under "App Driven Orchestration."

![](screenshots/100/21.png)

Name your integration. 

![](screenshots/100/22.png)

Click the + sign on the empty canvas and select "AllPurposeRestTrigger", if you don't have that click HERE. 

![](screenshots/100/23.png)

Configure the REST adapter to receive the POST action. You can create your own relative resource URI. Configure a payload and response for the endpoint. Then click Next.

![](screenshots/100/24.png)

On the request page, select JSON Sample and click inline. 

![](screenshots/100/25.png)

Paste the below JSON snippet:
```

{"ProductID":"","ProductName":"","CreationDate":"","Division":"","Description":"","ApprovalStatus":""}

```

Then click Next and do the same for the response configuration.
![](screenshots/100/26.png)

Paste the below JSON snippet into the response sample payload:

```

{"response":""}

```
Click next until you return to the orchestration screen.

![](screenshots/100/27.png)

In between the CPQ adapter and 'Map to' click the + sign and select your SOAP connection to your CPQ environment. 

![](screenshots/100/28.png)

Begin configuring trhe endpoint by naming it and clicking next.

![](screenshots/100/29.png)

Select the add operation and press next. You don't need anything for the headers so click next again.

![](screenshots/100/30.png)

Your summary page should look like this, press done. 

![](screenshots/100/31.png)

Back on the orchestration screen, press save. Then click the 'Map to [your SOAP CONNECTION]' and press then pen symbol.

![](screenshots/100/32.png)

The mapping screen looks like this, drag and drop the fields from the left to their respective fields on the right. Leave the id field under 'each_record' on the right blank. 

![](screenshots/100/33.png)

Hold your cursor on the fields on the left and drag them to the right to their respective fields. 

![](screenshots/100/34.png)

After dragging the fields, click table_name - we need to hardcode the name of the table here. (NOTE: You could also have a table name field in the JSON payload and map that field to this field.)

![](screenshots/100/35.png)

On this screen simply type 'ProductMappings' or whatever you named your table in CPQ. Save and close this screen afterwards.

![](screenshots/100/36.png)

Your mapping should look like this, press validate and close.

![](screenshots/100/37.png)

Now click the "Map to sendToCPQ" (or whatever you named your REST adapter), and press the pen.

![](screenshots/100/38.png)

Here, we will map the response field. Click response.
![](screenshots/100/39.png)

On the left side of the screen, go down to mapping components and find concat. Then drag and drop it to the area on the right. 

![](screenshots/100/40.png)

From the left, open source from the little arrow on the left. Find the ProductName field, drag and drop it from left to right onto 'string1.'
![](screenshots/100/41.png)

In string2 type:

```

" was added to CPQ successfully."

```

Press save, and close the mapping. 

![](screenshots/100/42.png)

Your (almost) completed integration should look like this. Click save and close on the top right. 
![](screenshots/100/43.png)

This integration was created in the old mapping, but in order for the integration to be run - you will import it to a new environment. We will now export the integration from this environment and import it to a new one. To do this, click the 4 horizontal lines to the far right of the integration and click export. This will save a .iar file to your downloads. 

![](screenshots/100/44.png)

In your new OIC environment - navigate to the same integrations screen and press import on the top right. 

![](screenshots/100/45.png)

A popup will appear, press choose file and select your respective .iar file. 

![](screenshots/100/46.png)

Then press import. 

![](screenshots/100/47.png)

Now open your imported integration and view the mapping. 

![](screenshots/100/48.png)

This is what your mapping should look like in the new UI. 

![](screenshots/100/49.png)

You can see your previously hardcoded table name here. 

![](screenshots/100/50.png)

You can see the concatenated response field in the response mapping. 

![](screenshots/100/51.png)

To find the concat function in the new mapping, click the arrow pointing leftwards, on the upper right, under validate. You don't need to place it in the mapping, this is just to show you where the new functions go in the new mapping.
![](screenshots/100/52.png)

Back on the orchestration screen, click the lines under save, then click tracking. 
![](screenshots/100/53.png)

Drag and drop ProductID to the box under tracking field. We will use this tracking field to monitor the integration. Press close on the bottom right.
![](screenshots/100/54.png)

Press save and close the integration. 
![](screenshots/100/55.png)

To activate your integration, press the radio button to the right of the connection symbols. 
![](screenshots/100/56.png)

This popup appears, check tracing and payload and then press activate. 
![](screenshots/100/57.png)

Your screen should look like this after doing so. 

### 4.	Test & Monitor the Integration

![](screenshots/100/58.png)

Press the arrow pointing to the right next to the green check box and then open the endpoint URL. 
![](screenshots/100/59.png)

This window will open, we will need this information in Postman. 
![](screenshots/100/60.png)

In Postman:

1. select the POST action
2. Paste the endpoint URL from the previous screen 
3. Configure authorization (BasicAuth or Oauth2 for OIC)
4. Past the payload (make sure you have raw & JSON selected in Postman)
5. Press send after these steps
![](screenshots/100/61.png)

After pressing send, you should see the previously configured response below. 
![](screenshots/100/62.png)

Return to CPQ to verify the entry was added to the data table. 
![](screenshots/100/63.png)

In OIC, go to monitoring and tracking. 
![](screenshots/100/64.png)

You can see the ProductID we designated as the tracking field. 
![](screenshots/100/65.png)

If you press the Product ID: 56781, you will then see this screen showing green for each step of the integration. 
![](screenshots/100/66.png)

Click the upper right and click activity stream. 
![](screenshots/100/67.png)

Navigate the popup and you can see the response payload and other information.
